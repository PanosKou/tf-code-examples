# nginx-ingress
Terraform module for deploying the nginx-ingress controller.

# Description
This uses a version of the official helm chart.

We will be making the external version being used more clear by completing CARG-138 and DEE-2145.

# Usage
For the first iteration of this component we are not enabling any bespoke configuration. We can add this over time as use-cases arise.
